Abstract: |
  As the novel coronavirus pandemic remains strong, this project intends
  to mitigate the contamination using certain devices that regulate the
  distance between bystanders, mainly in crowded and closed spaces. The
  first variation consists of a stationary device that controls the
  distance and pace of a queue. The other one is a wearable device that
  helps the user to keep his distance from others. The simulations were
  made on TinkerCad, and they've shown a high level of precision
